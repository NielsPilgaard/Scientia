Embark on a quest for knowledge that will lead you and mankind into a new golden age!

You start at the Dawn of Time, and have to discover new skills, resources and technologies in order to progress.

Colaborate with villages and rival other settlements on your journey towards understanding the world.

*   Learn Professions and master them to gain access to new abilities and recipes.  
*   The progression is guided by a thorough Advancement system.
*   Unique items, recipes and dimensions.
*   A large assortment of both Magic and Tech content.

### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Media</span>

*   You may NOT make Scientia content as this time.

### <span style="font-size: 24px;">Testing</span>

Join the Scientia Discord, and ask for permission to test the modpack. If accepted, follow these steps to setup the modpack:

You're done!

There are a few things I would like testers to consider/look for:

* Bugs of course, gotta squash 'em all.
* Things you find boring/tedious
* Things that need small optimizations, such as advancement text and textures.

I would also appreciate if you let me know what you think of the gameplay and why, especially if you didn't like it :)
